4. Relevant Information
    -- Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate, Sequential, Time-Series
    -- This dataset represents ambient data collected in homes with volunteer residents.
       Data are collected continuously while residents perform their normal routines.
       Ambient PIR motion sensors, door/temperature sensors, and light switch sensors
       are placed throughout the home of the volunteer.  The sensors are placed in locations
       throughout the home that are related to specific activites of daily living that we
       wish to capture.
    -- The classification task is to predict the activity that is occurring in the smart
       home and being observed by the ambient sensors.  The sensors communicate using the
       ZigBee Pro protocol, forming a mesh network with all battery powered sensors as leaf
       nodes and always-on devices (light switches and ZigBee relays) forming the branches
       that connect back to the USB gateway on our local SHiB [2] server.
    -- The original format captured from the sensors is provided, as well as the feature
       vector we generate using a sliding window of 30 sensor events.  Each annotated data
       file (ex: hh102/hh102.ann.txt) has a corresponding feature vector CSV file
       (ex: hh102/hh102.ann.features.csv).  Most of the sensor data files contain labels
       for two months of the collection period, though some contain labels for extended
       time periods.
    -- We have also included the entire dataset collected at each smart home in the original
       format (ex: hh102/hh102.rawdata.txt).
    -- An analysis of the attributes for each features CSV file is found in the corresponding
       readme (ex: hh102/hh102.ann.features.csv is described by
       hh102/hh102.ann.features.README.txt).
    -- The smart home layout, and sensor placement from the original formats is found
       in the included sensor map for each smart home (ex: hh102/hh102.sensor_map.png).
    -- The original format is:
       <Date> <Time> <Sensor> <Translate01> <Translate02> <Message> <SensorType> <Activity>
        -- <Date> is YYYY-MM-DD, in local time.
        -- <Time> is HH:MM:SS.ms, 24-hour and in local time.
        -- <Sensor> is the name of the sensor, this can be found on the sensor map.
        -- <Translate01> is the room-level sensor location.
        -- <Translate02> is more detailed, usually identifying what in the room the sensor
           is aimed at or sensing.
        -- <Message> is the message generated by the sensor (we define these in more detail
           below).
        -- <SensorType> is the type of sensor generating the event, so you know what to
           expect for a message.  In these earlier smart homes many of the sensors could
           be identified by their name, but in later configurations you had to use this
           field to identify what sensor was sending the message.
        -- Motion Sensor Package
           Each motion sensor package contains a PIR motion detector and a resistive photocell
           light sensor. The package also reports it's battery level and regularly checks
           in with the sensor network (ZigBee Check-Ins).
            -- Control4-Motion and Control4-MotionArea
               Most motion sensors have a sticker in the lens that limits what it can see
               to approximately a 3-foot diameter circle when mounted on the ceiling facing
               down. Some motion sensors that do not have any sticker limiting their view
               are called Control4-MotionArea and can detect motion within view, though
               sensitivity to smaller body movements may be reduced beyond 20 feet.
                -- Message Values
                   Motion and MotionArea sensors always report ON or OFF.
                -- Frequency
                   The sensor will instantly send an ON message when detecting motion.
                   1.25 seconds after it no longer observes motion the sensor will send OFF.
            -- Control4-LightSensor
                -- Message Values
                   The light sensor will send integer values ranging from 0 to 100 (pitch
                   black to very bright). The Motion sensors with stickers in the lens have
                   a much more limited amount of light that hits the sensor, and may only
                   observe a range from 0 to 10, with a rare spike to a much higher value
                   when the lid is removed to replace a battery.
                -- Frequency
                   The current light level is bit-packed and sent with every message the
                   package sends on ZigBee, but the light sensor itself can initiate a ZigBee
                   message if the value changes by 15% from the last value it reported.
            -- Control4-BatteryPercent
                -- Message Values
                   The battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.
                -- Frequency
                   The battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but
                   only report when there is a change.  This means that some battery values
                   may not be updated for days as the level has not changed.
            -- Control4-Radio
               These sensor messages were enabled when we upgraded our data collection systems
               around 2014.
                -- Message Values
                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.
                -- Frequency
                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 30 minutes.
                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has
                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee
                   network.
        -- Door Sensor Package
            -- Control4-Door
                -- Message Values
                   The door sensor always report OPEN or CLOSE.
                -- Frequency
                   The sensor sends the message as soon as the magnetic reed switch changes.
            -- Control4-Temperature
               All door sensor packages have an internal temporature sensor, and the ability
               to attach a second temperature probe.  This was used in some of the bathrooms
               for measuring the temperature at the door and right next to the shower.
                -- Message Values
                   Messages are a decimal in Celsius with 0.5 degrees Celsius accuracy.
                -- Frequency
                   Messages are sent when the sensor detects a change in the measured
                   temperature by 0.5 Celsius.
            -- Control4-BatteryPercent
                -- Message Values
                   The battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.
                -- Frequency
                   The battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but
                   only report when there is a change.  This means that some battery values
                   may not be updated for days as the level has not changed.
            -- Control4-Radio
                -- Message Values
                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.
                -- Frequency
                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 30 minutes.
                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has
                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee
                   network.
        -- Light Switch Package
            -- Control4-Light
                -- Message Values
                   Light switch messages are integer values ranging from 0 to 100.  Some of
                   the lights are dimmers, they report the change in value from 0 to 100 as
                   they ramp up their brightness.  The switches simply report 0 or 100 when
                   they turn off or on.
                -- Frequency
                   The light switches only report light messages when the value changes.
            -- Control4-Button
               With the data collection upgrade in 2014 we were able to start collecting
               sensor events from residents interacting with the light switches.
                -- Message Values
                   The buttons have a variety of messages they send.  TAP is sent every time
                   the button is pressed.  When the button is doing being tapped, the button
                   will send TAP_COUNT_01 if the button was tapped once (we have observed
                   tap counts as high as 12, but do not know the limit of the device).
                   On the dimmer light switches there are also the DEPRESS and RELEASE messages
                   that are sent then the button is held down to slowly dim the light up
                   or down.
                -- Frequency
                   Messages are only sent with a participant interacts with the button.
            -- Control4-Radio
                -- Message Values
                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.
                -- Frequency
                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 15 minutes.
                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has
                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee
                   network.
